## Requirements

### General

- All files should be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using MySQL 5.7 (version 5.7.30).
- All SQL queries should be commented.
- Use uppercase for all SQL keywords (SELECT, WHERE, etc.).
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.

### Task-specific

- Each task has specific requirements outlined in its description.
- Pay attention to the details, such as file naming and comments.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-backend-storage.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd alx-backend-storage/0x00-MySQL_Advanced
   ```

3. Execute the SQL scripts on your MySQL server.

## Additional Information

### Container-on-demand

- Use "container-on-demand" to run MySQL.
- Ask for a container with Ubuntu 18.04 - Python 3.7.
- Connect via SSH or use the WebTerminal.
- Start MySQL in the container:

  ```bash
  service mysql start
  ```

### Importing a SQL Dump

```bash
echo "CREATE DATABASE your_database;" | mysql -uroot -p
curl "https://path-to-your-sql-dump.sql" -s | mysql -uroot -p your_database
echo "SELECT * FROM your_table;" | mysql -uroot -p your_database
```

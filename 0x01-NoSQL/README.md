### More Information

- Install MongoDB 4.2 in Ubuntu 18.04 using the [official installation guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/).
- Example installation steps:
  ```bash
  $ wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.2.asc | apt-key add -
  $ echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.2 multiverse" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.2.list
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
  ...
  $ sudo service mongod status
  mongod start/running, process 3627
  $ mongo --version
  MongoDB shell version v4.2.8
  ...
  $ pip3 install pymongo
  $ python3
  >>> import pymongo
  >>> pymongo.__version__
  '3.10.1'
  ```
- Potential issue resolution:
  - If document creation doesnâ€™t work or encounters the error "Data directory /data/db not found, terminating," run:
    ```bash
    $ sudo mkdir -p /data/db
    ```
  - If /etc/init.d/mongod is missing, find an example of the file [here](#).

   ```bash
   $ cat 1-use_or_create_database | mongo
   ```

3. **Insert document**

   - Write a script that inserts a document in the collection `school` with the name "Holberton school."

   ```bash
   $ cat 2-insert | mongo my_db
   ```

4. **All documents**

   - Write a script that lists all documents in the collection `school`.

   ```bash
   $ cat 3-all |
   ```

mongo my_db

````

5. **First document**
- Write a script that lists all documents with `name: "Holberton school"` in the collection `school`.

```bash
$ cat 4-match | mongo my_db
````

6. **Update document**

   - Write a script that updates the first document with the name "Holberton school" to "New School" in the collection `school`.

   ```bash
   $ cat 5-update | mongo my_db
   ```

7. **Delete by match**

## How to use MongoDB Aggregations

- Aggregations are a powerful way to manipulate data in MongoDB. They allow you to process data records and return computed results. Below is a basic example:

### Aggregation Pipeline

- Aggregation in MongoDB is a series of data transformation stages. Each stage takes an input and produces an output. The output of one stage serves as the input for the next.

### Example

- In this example, we have a collection `sales` with documents representing sales transactions. Each document has the fields `item` (product name), `quantity` (number of items sold), and `price` (price per item).

#### Data

```json
[
  { "item": "apple", "quantity": 10, "price": 0.5 },
  { "item": "orange", "quantity": 5, "price": 0.75 },
  { "item": "banana", "quantity": 8, "price": 0.4 }
]
```

#### Aggregation

- Suppose we want to calculate the total revenue for each product. We can use the aggregation pipeline to achieve this.

```bash
$ mongo my_db --eval 'db.sales.aggregate([
  {
    $project: {
      item: 1,
      total: { $multiply: ["$quantity", "$price"] }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$item",
      totalRevenue: { $sum: "$total" }
    }
  }
])'
```

#### Result

```json
{ "_id" : "banana", "totalRevenue" : 3.2 }
{ "_id" : "orange", "totalRevenue" : 3.75 }
{ "_id" : "apple", "totalRevenue" : 5 }
```

### Breakdown

- The aggregation pipeline consists of two stages:
  1. **$project:** This stage reshapes the documents by including the `item` field and creating a new field `total` calculated as the product of `quantity` and `price`.
  2. **$group:** This stage groups the documents by `item` and calculates the total revenue for each group using the $sum accumulator.

### Applying Aggregations to This Project

- For more advanced operations, you might want to explore MongoDB's aggregation framework. It's a powerful tool for manipulating and analyzing data. To incorporate aggregations into this project, consider adding an optional task or section exploring aggregations in the context of the provided data.

## Advanced Usage

- This project covers basic interactions with MongoDB using Python and the mongo shell. For more advanced use cases, consider exploring features such as indexing, sharding, and replication. These features can enhance the performance, scalability, and reliability of your MongoDB deployment.
